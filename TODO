# TODO

_In no specific order_

* ~catch keyboard error~
* deal with bluesky exceptions
    * Properly print result struct
    * ESPECIALLY!  Move tried posts back into queue!
* Debugging option for more verbosity
* perhaps logging?  Yet systemd expects status from stdout...
* Multiuser - requirement for running as a service
